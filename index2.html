    <h1> About Me! </h1>
    <h2> Hi! I'm Nathan Tran, I am a junior currently taking AP Computer Science Principles. I had not had any coding experience or knowlegde prior to this class and hoped to learn more about the basics of computer science. Taking this class has taught me so much about coding and the elemets of coding and I'm glad I took this class. I've learned so much information that I couldn't have otherwise. I hope that I got a 4 on the AP exam and thank you Mrs. Sandstrom for teaching us.    </h2>
