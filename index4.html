  <h1> CODE.org Projects </h1>
    <h2> These are the projects that I made in AP Computer Science using code.org.  </h2>

  <p> Our multiscreen app project was our first introduction to creating apps on code.org. For this project we learned how to design apps on the program and learned the basics to using onEvents. </p>

  <p> In our digital design app project, we used the pen tool to create a digital scene. The project taught us how to use functions, parameters, and loops in our code. It was a really fun project to create. </p>

  <p> For our conditional app, we were given a lot of control over the app we could create. The only requirements was that the app must use a conditional, parameter, loop, and function. The project taught us how to use boolean statements to create different outcomes in our app. </p>

  <p> This is my final Data Set Project and also my AP Project. For this project we put together all coding elements we learned in the class. It required a function, parameters, boolean statements, and modified lists. I like how my project came out, as I felt that I implementing all the concepts that I learned in AP Computer Science. </p>
